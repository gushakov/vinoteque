Vinoteque
---------

This is a simple standalone application for personal use. It is based on Java
Swing GUI and build with NetBeans, Maven and Spring 3.1.1. This application uses
HSQLDB embedded database.

The application itself is a virtual winecellar allowing for the management of
the wine bottles. For now the interface is available only in French.

Technical details
-----------------

I've used NetBeans Maven project for this application. To build the application
use Maven command

> mvn assembly:assembly verify

It should build an executable using launch4j plugin. See pom.xml for more details.
